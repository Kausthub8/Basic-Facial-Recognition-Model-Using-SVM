# Basic-Facial-Recognition-Model-Using-SVM


a. Dimension reduction is done by using PCA(principal Component Anlaysis) technique.

b. Acheived a f1_score of 0.85 (f1_score is basically weighted average of precision and recall)

c. To get maximum margin, Linear classifier was used.

d. Model is evaluated using Grid-Search Cross validation

e. The classifierâ€™s out-of-sample performance and asscociated recovery statistics are computed using the classification report
